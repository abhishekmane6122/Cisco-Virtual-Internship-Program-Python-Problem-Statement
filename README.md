# Cisco-Virtual-Internship-Program-Python-Problem-Statement 2022 


I had the pleasure of interning at Cisco Networking Academy this summer in their 2022 AICTE Virtual Internship Program. I learned a great deal about how Python is used in the field of communication, and I had the opportunity to improve my Python coding skills.

One of the projects I worked on was validating IPv4 addresses. I converted the addresses to different forms and transferred them to a file. This project was challenging, but it was also a valuable learning experience. I gained a deeper understanding of how IPv4 addresses work, and I improved my Python skills.

I am grateful for the opportunity to have interned at Cisco Networking Academy. I learned a lot and I had a great time. I am excited to use my new skills in my future career.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Task 1: Ask the user to input 10 ipv4 addresses.

Task 2: Check if the addresses are valid ipv4 addresses.

Task 3: Convert the ipv4 addresses which are in decimal format to Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal format For conversion use functions (inbuilt or library)

Task 4:Create a list which will hold the addresses. [Decimal, Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal]

Task 5: Transfer the contents of the list to a file named conversion.txt

Task 6: Print the following output on the screen (O/P OF TASK 4)
